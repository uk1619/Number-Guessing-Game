The number guessing game is a simple yet engaging program created using Python. In this game, the computer randomly selects a number within a specified range, typically between 1 and 100. The player's objective is to guess this number in as few attempts as possible. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. This feedback helps guide the player towards the correct answer. The game continues until the player successfully guesses the number. This project is a great way to practice fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and random number generation in Python.
